# ToneIn-webapp

ToneIn is an community-based application where people can establish healthier new relationship with unknown ones and at the same time keep their familiar circle close.

Nowadays varieties of social medias, SNS sites and messaging apps all failed to bring people closer, but instead, the prosperity of those apps give birth to serials of new 'monsters', such as 'cyber-mobs'，people just keep posting toxic comments or texts online freely and those platforms or apps did very little to regulate.

We believe that the fundamental of a healthy connect should be based on heathy community and that's what ToneIn is all about, like what it's meant by Chinese, "synchronize our voices"

It's pretty diffcult for us to made up mind to initialize this project for all sorts of different reasons, but those two things below inspired and made up our minds:

 - [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) globally spreads through a very localized community back in Wuhan(where I spent 4 years earning my bachelor's degree):

    - how should we communicate to each other so that we can responde to things like that ASAP?
    - who should we believe or at least gain a peace of mind to figure out what to do next, before there is any data to actually told us what to do

 - [Reckful](https://twitter.com/byron) suicided in his apartment because of major depression:

    - what can we actually do to stop the 'cyber-mob' and those toxic behavior, systematically?(I put very little faith in human beings regulate themselves, FYI)

    - how can we really find someone or groups that deeply understand what us self are expericing and willing to give the helping hand or if there's not one out there, one can easily build one.
